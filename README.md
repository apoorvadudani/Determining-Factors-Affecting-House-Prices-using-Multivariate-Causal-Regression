# Determining-Factors-Affecting-House-Prices-using-Multivariate-Causal-Regression

## Background

Acme Realty is a real estate company specializing in listings in upscale Hillsborough, California (CA). I analyze their real estate data with the intent of understanding the variables that explain sales amounts. I collect a set of home sales detail data, shown below, which includes house characteristics of properties which have sold recently. 
 
The home sales detail data shows house characteristics of homes sold in Hillsborough, CA during the time period of 2008-2011, based on data from online real estate website Zillow. The home sales detail data includes the variables House, Price ($M), House (K sf), Lot (K sf), Bedrooms, and Bathrooms. The House column shows the house address for each house sold, with house numbers replacing actual house addresses for privacy reasons. Price ($M) shows the sales price for each house in millions of US dollars. House (K sf) shows the size of the interior of the house in thousands of square feet. Lot (K sf) shows the size of the building lot in thousands of square feet. Bedrooms shows the total number of bedrooms. Bathrooms shows the total number of bathrooms.
